## Overview
This repository contains R code and documentation for a comprehensive exploration of geospatial features, focusing on LiDAR and image processing techniques. The project covers various tasks, including managing large LiDAR datasets, creating Digital Terrain Models (DTM), generating hillshades, and conducting image processing using remotely sensed data.

## Key Topics
- **LiDAR Processing:**
  - Efficient handling of LiDAR datasets using LAS catalogs.
  - Generating Digital Terrain Models (DTM) and hillshades.
  - Creating Normalized Digital Surface Models (nDSM) and Canopy Height Models (CHM).

- **Image Processing:**
  - Computing the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Landsat 8 data.
  - Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Tasseled Cap Transformation to multispectral imagery.
  - Analyzing the impact of environmental changes using indices like dNBR (differenced Normalized Burn Ratio).

- **Moving Windows and Edge Detection:**
  - Utilizing moving windows for local pattern analysis.
  - Performing edge detection to identify features in the data.

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required R packages mentioned in the documentation.
3. Follow the provided R scripts and examples for geospatial analysis tasks.
4. Explore different sections for in-depth insights into LiDAR and image processing techniques.

## Additional Resources
- The documentation provides detailed explanations and annotations for each code block.
